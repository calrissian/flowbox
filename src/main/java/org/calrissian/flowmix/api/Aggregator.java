/**
 * An aggregator over a progressive/tumbling window allows aggregate values like
 * sums and averages to be maintained for some window at some point in time
 * without the whole window being available at any point in time.
 *
 * This is very useful for associative algorithms that can be implemented
 * without the entire dataset being available. Often this is good for reduce
 * functions that can summarize a dataset without the need to see each
 * individual point.
 *
 * Multiple events can be returned as the aggregate if necessary, this means
 * multiple aggregates could be maintained inside and emitted separately (i.e.
 * sum and count and sumsqaure, and average).
